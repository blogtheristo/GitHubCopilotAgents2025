# Architecture: Agent-Based Business Transformation

## Overview
This repository implements a private agent-based business transformation framework that creates new capabilities (Prowess) and skills (Skills) for organizations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Private Implementation
- All agents operate within your private infrastructure
- Data remains under your control
- Customizable to your specific business needs

### 2. New Capabilities (Prowess)
Business-level capabilities that agents enable:
- **Customer Service Automation**: 24/7 intelligent support
- **Data Analysis & Insights**: Real-time business intelligence
- **Process Optimization**: Streamlined workflows
- **Content Generation**: Automated documentation and communication
- **Decision Support**: AI-assisted strategic planning

### 3. Skills
Technical skills that agents possess:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
- **Code Generation**: Automated software development
- **Data Processing**: ETL and analysis pipelines
- **Integration**: Connecting with existing systems
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement from interactions

### 4. Resource Liberation
Agents work where people already are:
- Integration with existing tools (Slack, Teams, Email)
- No need for new platforms or training
- Frees human resources for strategic work
- Reduces operational overhead
