# Business Capability: Process Optimization

## Overview
Intelligent process automation that identifies inefficiencies, streamlines workflows, and continuously optimizes business operations.

## Key Features
- Process mining and analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Automated workflow execution
- Resource allocation optimization
- Continuous improvement recommendations

## Business Impact
- **Efficiency Gains**: 30-50% reduction in process completion time
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced operational overhead
- **Quality Improvement**: Consistent, error-free execution
- **Scalability**: Handle increased volume without proportional cost increase

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Skills Needed
- Process mining and modeling
- Workflow automation
- Resource optimization algorithms
- Performance monitoring
- Integration orchestration

### Integration Points
- Business process management systems
- Project management tools (Jira, Asana)
- Communication platforms
- Document management systems
- ERP systems
