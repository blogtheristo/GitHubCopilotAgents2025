## Business Impact
- **Decision Speed**: Real-time insights instead of weekly reports
- **Accuracy**: Reduced human error in data processing
- **Accessibility**: Non-technical users can query data
- **Proactive Management**: Early warning on trends and issues

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Skills Needed
- Data processing and ETL
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning models
- Data visualization
- Natural language to SQL conversion

### Integration Points
- Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
- Business intelligence tools (Tableau, Power BI)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Communication platforms for alerts
