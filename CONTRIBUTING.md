### 2. Contribution Process

#### For Documentation
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b docs/my-improvement`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "docs: improve customer service example"`
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin docs/my-improvement`
6. Open a Pull Request

#### For Code
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Write your code with tests
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "feat: add new integration"`
6. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
7. Open a Pull Request

### 3. Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add Microsoft Teams integration
fix: resolve Slack authentication issue
docs: add deployment guide for AWS
refactor: simplify NLP processing pipeline
test: add unit tests for data processing
```

### 4. Code Style Guidelines

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for all functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```python
def process_customer_query(query: str, customer_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a customer query and return response.
    
    Args:
        query: Customer's question or request
        customer_id: Unique customer identifier
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing response and metadata
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

#### YAML/JSON
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for YAML, 2 or 4 for JSON)
- Add comments for complex configurations
- Keep files organized and readable

#### Markdown
- Use clear headings hierarchy
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Add examples where applicable
- Keep line length reasonable (80-120 characters)

### 5. Documentation Standards

When documenting a new capability:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of what it does
2. **Key Features**: Bullet points of main features
3. **Business Impact**: Measurable benefits
4. **Implementation Requirements**: What's needed to implement
5. **Configuration Example**: Practical YAML/JSON example
6. **Success Metrics**: How to measure success
7. **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios

### 6. Testing

For code contributions:
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Ensure integration tests pass
- Test with different configurations
- Document test coverage

### 7. Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR within 1-2 weeks
2. Address any feedback or requested changes
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged
4. Your contribution will be acknowledged in release notes

### 8. Questions and Support

- Open an issue for questions
- Join discussions for feature proposals
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Be respectful and constructive

### 9. Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Assume positive intent
- No harassment or discrimination

### 10. License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.

## Recognition

Contributors will be:
- Listed in the repository contributors
- Mentioned in release notes
- Acknowledged in documentation

## Getting Started

Not sure where to start? Look for issues labeled:
- `good-first-issue` - Great for newcomers
- `help-wanted` - We need your expertise
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements needed

## Examples of Good Contributions

### Example 1: Adding a New Integration
```markdown
# Integration: Discord

## Overview
Integration enabling agents to operate within Discord servers...

[Complete documentation following our standards]
```

### Example 2: Improving a Skill
```python
# Improved NLP processing with caching
def classify_intent_cached(message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Classify intent with caching for performance.
    
    Implements LRU cache to speed up repeated queries.
    """
    cache_key = hashlib.md5(message.encode()).hexdigest()
    # Implementation with caching
```

### Example 3: Adding Metrics
```yaml
# Enhanced monitoring configuration
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - name: "response_time_p95"
      threshold: 2000  # milliseconds
      alert: true
    - name: "error_rate"
      threshold: 0.01  # 1%
      alert: true
```
